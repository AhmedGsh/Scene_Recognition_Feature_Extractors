A widely considered problem in Computer Vision is scene recognition. Its important in many applications since it defines a context for object recognition. However, with the abundance of image data sets and the rise of deep neural networks, scene recognition hasn't found as much success as other tasks such as object classification. In this paper we dissect and examine the pipeline of scene recognition algorithms. We treat this process as two separate stages: feature extraction and classification. We consider different feature descriptors, traditional and neural network based methods. We also explore different approaches to combine different feature vectors. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance of different descriptors, dimensionality reduction techniques and classifiers on the Places365 dataset.
